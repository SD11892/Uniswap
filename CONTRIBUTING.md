# Translations

Help Uniswap cover more languages!

## Translation file format

We use the PO file to manage translations. 
See [Working with PO Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/gnun/html_node/PO-Files.html#PO-Files)

## Translating the Interface to a new language

**WIP INSTRUCTIONS**

Uniswap Interface uses [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/) and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/uniswap-interface) ([Crowdin Introduction for Translators](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/))
to manage locales and translations.
