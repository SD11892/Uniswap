        <p>Uniswap is an automated market maker exchange capable of both ETH-to-ERC20 and ERC20-to-ERC20 trades. Anyone can become a liquidity provider, and invest in the liquidity pool of an ERC20 token. This allows other users to trade that token for other tokens at an exchange rate based on their relative availibility. When a token trade is executed, a small fee is payed to the liquidity providers that enabled the transaction, proportional to their investment.</p>
